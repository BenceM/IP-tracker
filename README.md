## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process

### Built with

- Vite
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this simple exercise I've learned to use leaflet, improved my understanding of apis and environment variables.

### Continued development

In the future, my plan is to use more libraries, frameworks and languages to deal with problems in a faster and more streamlined manner.

### Useful resources
